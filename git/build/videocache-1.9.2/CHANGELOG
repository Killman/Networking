* Mon Mar 9 2009 <kulbirsaini@students.iiit.ac.in>
Entire plugin has been restructured.
Base plugin is now totally separate from the downloading/caching process which will facilitate enhanced performance.
Disk size calculation will no more hang up the plugin.
Directory size is not calculated before every download now.
The calculated size of the cache directories is cached for next 50 downloads.
The caching mechanism is not based on time because cache size will not increase unless there is a download.
The cached directory size stays with XMLRPC server.
The size calculation is done in a forked daemon so that the normal plugin behavior is not affected.
Cache size calculator function is also made generic. Earlier it used to work for 2 level deep directories.
VideoIDPool class is revised to remove unnecessary functions.
'start' and 'begin' parameters are dropped from url while downloading for caching.
Logfiles are rotated properly now. Logfile rotation doesn't require restarting squid.

* Fri Feb 20 2009 <kulbirsaini@students.iiit.ac.in>
If there is only one cache directory, apache alias will be /videocache instead of /videocache/0 .
